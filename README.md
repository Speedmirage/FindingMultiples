# What this Program does?

This program allows one to input two distict integers and returns true if the second integer inputed is a multiple of the first. Else the program will return false. Moreover, the program will also return a number which signifies the remainder of the performed division (used to check if the two values are multiples of each other).

## Things to Keep in Mind
1. This program will **immediately quit** if the second value entered is larger than the first one.
