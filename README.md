# What this Program does?

This program allows one to input **two distict integers and returns true if the second integer inputed is a multiple of the first**. Else the program will *return false*. Moreover, the program will also return a number which signifies the remainder of the performed division (used to check if the two values are multiples of each other).

## Things to Keep in Mind
1. This program will **immediately quit** if the second value entered is larger than the first one. 

## How to Run it?
1. First, run [Finding Multiples](http://cpp.sh/5qem)
2. Then, just have fun and enjoy it!
